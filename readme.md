 #### Backend part:
* After downloading the project, firstly you should create the .env file at the backend directory, and copy everything from .env.example file then change 
    ~~~~
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=homestead

    ~~~~
  to your database connection.
 * Navigate to backend folder and run `composer install` to install all dependcies which laravel framework requires.
 * Then run `php artisan migrate` to define all the tables on mysql database.
 * Finally run `php artisan db:seed --class=TodoSeeder` to load some dummy data.
 * All routes, model, and controller are predefined  and loaded for you. You can only focus on implementing REST API inside TOdoController.
 * You can run `php artisan route:list` to see all predefined routes.
 * PS: all php artisan command should be ran at backend directory. Because the artisan file is located at backend directory.
